Please fill in answers to the questions below:


1. What's your name?
Kia Zafar

2. What hostname did you deploy to?
kia.town

3. What's the link to your repository on github with your code?
https://github.com/KiaboyZ/CS4550-hw02

4. How many HTML / CSS tutorial exercises did you do?
Maybe 20 or so total?

5. How comfortable do you feel with HTML and CSS now?
Maybe a 5 out of 10. I can figure it out but it takes a lot of troubleshooting/googling.
I need to do more exercises.

6. How many JS tutorial exercises did you do?
I think around 5 to 10. I mostly went to the exercises when I had a specific problem.

7. How comfortable do you feel with JS now?
6 or 7 out of 10. It isn't all that different from some of the languages I already know.
I just need to nail the specifics and syntax down mostly.

8. Do all of your HTML pages pass the W3C HTML validator?
(https://validator.w3.org/)
They all had a warning to add a lang attribute and an error that character encoding had
not been declared. I have now fixed this in each file and they all pass.

9. Which parts of this assignment did you have trouble with, if any?
I had trouble with all of the assignment. At first with forgetting stuff from last week
and slowly realizing that I followed the config file instructions incorrectly. After
fixing that, I had trouble with getting the html file to recognize the css file. Once
I fixed that, I had trouble with the javascript portion of the assignment. I watched some
tutorials that gave me an idea of some concepts that I could mix with my own ideas, but
I wasn't really implementing them correctly. Lots of syntax issues, unnessecary parts,
and incorrect data referencing. This took me a good while, but I started over and payed
more attention when I was applying my code. I was able to get a working product in the end.
